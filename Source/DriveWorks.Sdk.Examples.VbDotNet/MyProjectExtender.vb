    ''' <remarks>
    ''' Note the allowRunDuringLoad parameter Is set to true.
    ''' This will cause DriveWorks to initialize the function And make it available to rules before the project opens.
    ''' Because the function Is initialized before the project has been fully loaded
    ''' the function might Not have access to any objects related to the project such
    ''' as form controls, variables, etc when it Is executed. This option Is only recommended
    ''' for functions that rely solely on the parameters or object data which does not interact with DriveWorks.
    ''' Such as this one.
